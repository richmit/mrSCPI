This directory contains the source code for mrSCPI as well as a few utility programs:

 - mrSCPI Code
   - mrSCPI.rb:: The primary mrSCPI program and library
 - Utilities
   - teAlias.rb:: Utility script to expand mrSCPI nicknames
   - mrNetwork.rb:: Utility script to query host network name from the mrSCPI RC file
   - mrOnBench.rb:: Utility script to query host location (on/off bench) from the mrSCPI RC file

The last two utilities are probably not very interesting to anyone
other than myself; however, the first one is handy if you have your RC
file setup.  It allows you to use mrSCPI nicknames in shell scripts or
on the command line.  For example, I open a browser (MSedge) on my
Tektronix TDS3052B with a command like the following:

#+begin_src sh
edge.sh `teAlias.rb tek3kw`
#+end_src
